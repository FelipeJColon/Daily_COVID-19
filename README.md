#### Investigation of numbers of reported cases

The number of daily tests conducted in the UK had been decreasing until 13/03/2020, whilst the number of cases has been increasing. I was interested in whether the number of reported cases is truly reflective of the number of infected people in the UK. 

To investigate this, I've calculated estimated case fatality rates (CFR) from available UK data which can be used to indicate total cases (if the number of reported cases is accurate, the calculated CFR should be equal to the expected CFR). The expectation is that CFR is around 3.4 % as reported by the WHO; CFR is variable between populations and calculation methods, however would falln somewhere in this ball park. The cumulative number of deaths in the UK is reported each day, but these people would have been infected (and their cases reported) as some time previously. Available [data](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus) suggest that time from symptom onset to death is around 14-22 days and that time from symptom onset to reporting is around 5 days, so I have calculated that the time from reporting to death is in the realm of 9 to 17 days. I have plotted calculated CFR using total deaths as a percentage of cumulative cases reported at 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 days previously (one line on the graph per time from reporting to death). 

Even with the minimum time from reporting to death estimated previously (9 days), the calculated CFR at time of estimated reporting is consitently above 10%. With other estimates of time from reporting to death, the calculated CFR are even higher. Importantly, this is not consistent with the ball-park expected CFR (~3.4%), meaning that either the true UK CFR is much much higher than expected or, more likely I think, that the number of cases reported significantly underestimates the number of true cases in the UK population.
